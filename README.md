This repository contains the Matlab codes used for the paper "Computer-assisted proofs for some nonlinear diffusion problems" by M. Breden. 

All the computer-assisted parts of the proofs discussed in the paper can be reproduced by running script_PM.m (Section 2 of the paper), 
script_SKT.m (Section 3 of the paper) and script_NP.m (Section 4 of the paper). 

The code does not require the Intlab toolbox (http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/intlab/) to run, but without it the results are not guaranteed 
to be immune to rounding errors.
